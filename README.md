My Apps 4 Septa App!

This was an old app from a hackathon in Philly, I created this visualization and technique for better understanding the routes and for users to dynamically explore the routes locally and in realtime.

I left a copy of it running here: http://middle.camp/septa/

Enjoy! :)

Please contact me for a commercial license if you want to use it that way.
